# Nomeco - Privacy Policy
## Data Collection
The only data that Nomeco collects from you is your User ID, along with the Server ID(s) you use the bot in.

## Storage of Data
Your data is stored securely in a JSON file, that only the bot developer, `@literally.nick` has access to.

## Access to Data
Your data cannot be accessed by anyone except the bot developer. Manipulation of data only occurs for testing/development purposes, or if a player is found to be collecting inorganic currency. The user has the right to access their own data by running the `data` prefix command. If they would like access to the JSON version of their data, they may do so by Direct Messaging `@literally.nick`.\
