# Nomeco - Privacy Policy
## Data Collection
The only data that Nomeco collects from you is your User ID and username, along with the Server ID(s) you use the bot in.

## Storage of Data
Your data is stored securely in a JSON file, that only the bot developer, `@literally.nick` has access to. This prevents unauthorized data manipulation.

## Access to Data
Your data can be accessed by anyone, by the use of the `data` prefix command. This is because your username and user ID is public data, available to anyone via Discord. Manipulation of this data, however, is protected. Data can only be manipulated by the bot developer. Data manipulation will only occur when there is inorganic currency in a user's account, or for development, testing, and feature implementation purposes.
## Data Registration and Data Deletion
Upon using Nomeco for the first time, or if you have unregistered from Nomeco, you will notice that attempting to use the `balance`, `apply`, `work`, `rob`, and other prefix commands will not work, and will tell you that you are not registered. To register, you can run the `register` prefix command, as it tells you. However, you can **un**register from Nomeco at any time, by using the `unregister` prefix command. This command deletes *ALL* of your data from Nomeco, and is ***NOT*** reversable! Please use this command with caution.\
