# Nomeco - Global Announcements
Nomeco's Global Announcements feature is quite a unique one. While turning this feature off is an available option, it is heavily recommended to keep it on. Nomeco will send a Global Announcement to your server for things such as Lotteries, Nomeco updates, Nomeco Terms of Service updates, and more.
## Enabling and Disabling Global Announcements
To disable Global Announcements in your server, simply run the `ga enable` or `ga disable` prefix command in your server.
